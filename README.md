The 2048 Game is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when no more moves are possible.

**How to Play**
Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide the tiles in the corresponding direction.
Goal: Combine tiles of the same value to create a larger value (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, etc.). Keep combining tiles to reach the target tile with a value of 2048.
Winning Condition: The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 is created.
Losing Condition: The game is lost when there are no empty spaces or valid moves left.

**Game Rules**
Tile Merging: Tiles of the same value that collide during a move merge into one, forming a new tile with double the original value.
New Tile: After each move, a new tile (usually with a value of 2 or 4) appears in a random empty spot on the grid.
Strategy: The key to winning is careful planning, strategic merges, and managing space on the grid.
